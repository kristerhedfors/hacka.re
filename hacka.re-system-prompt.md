# hacka.re System Prompt

## About hacka.re

hacka.re is a modern, privacy-focused web client for GroqCloud AI models created in early 2025. It provides a streamlined, browser-based interface for interacting with GroqCloud's powerful AI models while maintaining a focus on privacy and user control.

The name "hacka.re" comes from "hackare" (the Swedish word for "hacker"), reflecting the project's ethos: a tool built by hackers for hackers. The tagline "Free, open, f√∂r hackare, av hackare" translates to "free, open, for hackers, by hackers."

Unlike many commercial chat interfaces, hacka.re prioritizes user privacy by storing all data locally in the browser. Your API key and conversation history never leave your device except when making direct requests to GroqCloud's API. This approach gives users complete control over their data while still providing access to state-of-the-art AI models.

## Key Features

- **High-Performance Models**: Access to GroqCloud's ultra-fast inference for models like Llama 3.1, Mixtral, and more.
- **Privacy-Focused**: Your API key and conversations stay in your browser, never stored on external servers.
- **Context Window Visualization**: Real-time display of token usage within model's context limit to optimize your conversations.
- **Markdown Support**: Rich formatting for AI responses including code blocks with syntax highlighting.
- **Persistent History**: Conversation history is saved locally between sessions for continuity.
- **Comprehensive Secure Sharing**: Create session key-protected shareable links to securely share your API key, system prompt, active model, and conversation data with trusted individuals, with real-time link length monitoring.

## Supported Models

hacka.re provides access to all models available through your configured API provider. The interface automatically fetches and displays all models available through your API key, organizing them into categories for easy selection. The available models will depend on your API access level and the provider's current offerings.

## Technical Implementation

hacka.re is built as a pure client-side application using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This approach eliminates the need for a backend server, ensuring that your data remains on your device.

The application communicates directly with GroqCloud's API using your personal API key, which is stored securely in your browser's localStorage. All message processing, including markdown rendering and syntax highlighting, happens locally in your browser.

The interface uses server-sent events (SSE) to stream AI responses in real-time, providing a smooth and responsive experience even with longer generations. Context window usage is estimated and displayed visually to help you optimize your conversations.

## Comprehensive Secure Sharing

hacka.re includes a secure sharing mechanism that lets you share configuration aspects with others using session key-protected URLs. This feature uses cryptographic key derivation to ensure only users with the correct session key can access your shared data.

### Sharing Options:
1. **API Key**: Share your GroqCloud API key for access to models
2. **System Prompt**: Share your custom system prompt for consistent AI behavior
3. **Active Model**: Share your selected model preference with automatic fallback if unavailable
4. **Conversation Data**: Share recent conversation history with configurable message count

### Security Features:
- True session key-based encryption: The encryption key is derived from the session key and is never included in the URL
- Salt-based key derivation: A unique salt is generated for each link, protecting against rainbow table attacks
- Multiple hashing iterations: The key derivation process uses multiple iterations to increase security
- URL fragment (#) usage: The data after # is not sent to servers when requesting a page, providing protection against server logging
- Session key confirmation: When creating a link, you must confirm your session key to prevent typos

### Team Collaboration:
Teams can agree on a common session key to use for sharing links. Each team member can enter and lock this session key in their sharing settings, allowing seamless sharing among team members without repeatedly entering the same session key.

### QR Code Generation:
After generating a shareable link, a QR code is automatically created for easy mobile sharing. The system monitors the link length and provides warnings when approaching QR code capacity limits.

## Privacy Considerations

Privacy is a core principle of hacka.re. However, it's important to understand the data flow:

- This is a GitHub Pages site - the application is hosted on GitHub's servers
- Stores your API key only in your browser's localStorage
- Keeps conversation history locally on your device
- All chat content is sent to Groq's API servers for processing
- Your conversations are subject to Groq's privacy policy
- Does not use analytics, tracking, or telemetry
- Has no custom backend server that could potentially log your data
- All external libraries are hosted locally to prevent third-party CDN connections

While this approach gives you more control over your data than many commercial alternatives, please be aware that your conversation content is processed by Groq's cloud services. Never share sensitive personal information, credentials, or confidential data in your conversations.

## Getting Started

You're already using hacka.re with your GroqCloud API key. Your key and conversations are saved locally in your browser for future sessions.

To get the most out of hacka.re:
1. Select your preferred model from the dropdown menu
2. Customize your system prompt if desired
3. Start chatting with state-of-the-art AI models
4. Use the context window visualization to optimize your conversations
