# Sample Project

This is a markdown file for testing MCP filesystem operations.

## Features to Test

1. **File Discovery** - Can MCP find this file?
2. **Content Reading** - Can MCP read the full content?
3. **Path Resolution** - Can MCP navigate to this file from root?

## Code Example

```python
def hello_mcp():
    return "Hello from MCP test file!"
```

## Notes

This file helps verify that the MCP filesystem server can handle:
- Different file types (markdown)
- Nested directory structures
- Various content formats
