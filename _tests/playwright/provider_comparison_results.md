# Provider Comparison Test Results

## Summary

Investigation of reported differences between Berget.ai and Groq Cloud deployments of GPT OSS 120B model, specifically the claim that Berget.ai prefixes replies with "analysis".

## Test Results

### Berget.ai Provider
- **API Key Detection**: ✅ **WORKING** - Auto-detected as "Berget.AI API key detected and auto-selected (mistralai/Magistral-Small-2506)"
- **Model Selected**: `mistralai/Magistral-Small-2506` (not GPT OSS 120B as expected)
- **API Response**: ❌ **NO RESPONSE** - Timeout after 30 seconds
- **Network Requests**: ❌ **ZERO REQUESTS MADE** - No network activity detected
- **Storage Issue**: ❌ **API KEY NOT SAVED** - localStorage remains empty after entry

### Groq Cloud Provider  
- **API Key Detection**: ✅ **WORKING** - Auto-detected as "GroqCloud API key detected and auto-selected (moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct)"
- **Model Selected**: `moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct` (not GPT OSS 120B as expected)
- **API Response**: ❌ **NO RESPONSE** - Timeout after 30 seconds
- **Network Requests**: ❌ **ZERO REQUESTS MADE** - No network activity detected  
- **Storage Issue**: ❌ **API KEY NOT SAVED** - localStorage remains empty after entry

## Key Findings

### 1. Model Selection Discrepancy
Neither provider was using the expected "GPT OSS 120B" model:
- **Berget.ai**: Auto-selected `mistralai/Magistral-Small-2506`
- **Groq**: Auto-selected `moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct` 

### 2. Storage System Failure
Critical issue preventing any API calls:
- API keys entered in settings modal are **not being saved to localStorage**
- The "Save API Key" button exists but is not visible/accessible
- Without saved API keys, no network requests can be made
- This explains why both providers fail identically

### 3. Provider Detection Working
The only part working correctly:
- Both API keys are properly detected and auto-select appropriate providers
- Provider detection messages appear as expected
- Console shows proper context window information for Groq, missing for Berget

### 4. No "Analysis" Prefix Testing Possible
Cannot test the reported "analysis" prefix issue because:
- No actual API responses received from either provider
- Storage system prevents API calls from being made
- Both providers fail at the same point (storage layer)

## Technical Details

### Console Output
**Berget.ai**: `No context window size found for model: mistralai/Magistral-Small-2506`  
**Groq**: `Using hardcoded context window size for moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct: 204800`

### Network Analysis
- **Total HTTP Requests**: 0 (for both providers)
- **API Endpoint Calls**: 0 (for both providers)  
- **Error Responses**: 0 (no requests made to fail)

### Storage Debug
- Initial localStorage: Empty
- After API key entry: Still empty
- After modal close: Still empty
- StorageService.getApiKey(): Not accessible/not saving

## Conclusions

### Immediate Issues
1. **Storage system broken** - API keys not persisting to localStorage
2. **Settings modal save mechanism failing** - Save button not accessible
3. **No network requests possible** - Cannot test actual provider responses

### Testing Recommendations  
1. **Fix storage system first** - Debug why API keys aren't saving
2. **Verify save button functionality** - Settings modal save mechanism needs repair
3. **Re-test with working storage** - Only then can provider differences be measured
4. **Confirm model selection** - Neither provider used expected GPT OSS 120B model

### Provider Difference Analysis
**Status**: ⚠️ **INCONCLUSIVE**  
Cannot determine if Berget.ai prefixes responses with "analysis" because no responses were received from either provider due to storage system failure.

## Next Steps

1. **Debug storage system** - Investigate why localStorage.setItem() calls aren't working for API keys
2. **Fix settings modal** - Ensure save button is properly accessible and functional  
3. **Re-run comparison** - Test both providers once storage is working
4. **Verify models** - Confirm both providers are using the same base model for fair comparison
5. **Document response differences** - Once both providers respond, analyze for "analysis" prefix patterns
