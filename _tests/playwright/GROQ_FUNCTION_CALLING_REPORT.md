**Date**: 2025-08-28  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All 15 models tested successfully

## Summary

All 15 Groq Cloud chat models successfully support function calling through code block format. The model selection persistence issue has been fixed.

## Key Findings

1. **Universal Function Support**: All Groq chat models support function calling
2. **Consistent Format**: All models use code block format for function results
3. **Model Persistence Fixed**: User-selected models now persist correctly across settings changes
4. **Minor Variations**: Some models (allam-2-7b, compound-beta variants) don't include function names in response text but still execute correctly

## Fixed Issues

### Model Selection Bug
- **Problem**: Model selection was reverting to kimi-k2-instruct regardless of user choice
- **Cause**: Auto-selection logic in settings-coordinator.js was overriding user selections
- **Fix**: Modified to respect user selections and only auto-select when no model is chosen

### Implementation Details
Fixed in:
- `js/components/settings/settings-coordinator.js` - Removed auto-selection override
- `js/components/settings/model-manager.js` - Added user selection tracking
- `js/components/settings/base-url-manager.js` - Reset model state on provider change

## Recommendations

1. **For Production**: All Groq models are suitable for function calling
2. **Best Performance**: llama-3.1-8b-instant for speed, kimi-k2-instruct for accuracy
3. **Cost Effective**: Use smaller models (8b variants) for simple functions
4. **Complex Functions**: Use larger models (70b, 120b) for complex multi-step functions
