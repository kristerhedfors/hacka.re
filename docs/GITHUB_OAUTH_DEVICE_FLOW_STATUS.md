# GitHub OAuth Device Flow Implementation Status

## Current State (2025-06-14)

### What's Working ✅
1. **UI Flow**: The GitHub Quick Connector button correctly triggers the device flow process
2. **Configuration**: GitHub is properly configured with `useDeviceFlow: true` in the quick connectors
3. **Code Path**: The implementation correctly routes GitHub to use `startDeviceFlow()` instead of `startAuthorizationFlow()`
4. **Error Interception**: Redirect-based OAuth attempts are properly intercepted with an informative modal explaining that Device Flow should be used instead

### The Core Issue ❌
GitHub's OAuth Device Flow endpoints (`https://github.com/login/device/code`) **do not support CORS headers**, making it impossible to call them directly from browser JavaScript. This results in:

```
Access to fetch at 'https://github.com/login/device/code' from origin 'http://localhost:8000' 
has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

This is a **fundamental limitation** of GitHub's API design, not a bug in hacka.re.

## Why This Matters

hacka.re is designed as a **serverless, client-side only application** for privacy and security reasons. All API calls are made directly from the browser. GitHub's OAuth implementation requires server-side calls, creating an architectural conflict.

## Paths Forward

### Option 1: Proxy Server (Compromises Privacy)
**Approach**: Implement a proxy server that forwards OAuth requests to GitHub
- **Pros**: Would make Device Flow work as intended
- **Cons**: 
  - Violates hacka.re's serverless architecture
  - Introduces privacy concerns (proxy sees tokens)
  - Requires hosting and maintenance

### Option 2: Personal Access Tokens (Recommended Short-term)
**Approach**: Have users manually create and enter GitHub Personal Access Tokens
- **Pros**: 
  - Works today without any code changes
  - Maintains serverless architecture
  - More secure (fine-grained permissions)
- **Cons**: 
  - Less convenient for users
  - Requires manual token management

**Implementation**:
1. Update the GitHub Quick Connector to show instructions for creating a PAT
2. Add a simple token input field instead of OAuth flow
3. Store the token securely in encrypted local storage

### Option 3: Browser Extension
**Approach**: Create a browser extension that can bypass CORS restrictions
- **Pros**: Could handle OAuth properly
- **Cons**: Requires users to install an extension

### Option 4: GitHub App with Installation Tokens
**Approach**: Use GitHub Apps instead of OAuth Apps
- **Pros**: Different auth mechanism that might work better
- **Cons**: More complex setup for users

### Option 5: Documentation Update (Immediate)
**Approach**: Update the UI to clearly explain the limitation
- Replace the "Connect" button with "Setup Instructions"
- Explain that GitHub requires a Personal Access Token
- Provide clear steps for token creation

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Update the GitHub Quick Connector UI to explain the CORS limitation and guide users to use Personal Access Tokens instead

2. **Short-term**: Implement a clean PAT input flow:
   ```javascript
   // Instead of OAuth flow, show a token input
   showTokenInputDialog(serviceKey) {
       // Display modal with:
       // - Instructions for creating a GitHub PAT
       // - Token scope requirements
       // - Secure input field
       // - Direct link to GitHub token settings
   }
   ```

3. **Long-term**: Investigate GitHub App installation tokens or consider an optional proxy service for users who want OAuth

## Code Changes Made

The following changes were made to attempt Device Flow support:

1. **Updated `/js/components/mcp/mcp-quick-connectors.js`**:
   - Added `useDeviceFlow: true` to GitHub config
   - Added device flow URL configuration
   - Modified `connectService()` to check for device flow
   - Updated to use `mcpOAuthFlow.showDeviceFlowInstructions()`

2. **Current Flow**:
   ```javascript
   if (savedConfig.useDeviceFlow || savedConfig.provider === 'github' || serviceKey === 'github') {
       // Attempts device flow but fails due to CORS
       const flowResult = await oauthService.startDeviceFlow(serverName, savedConfig);
   }
   ```

## Test Results

Created test file `_tests/playwright/test_github_device_flow.py` which confirmed:
- ✅ UI flow works correctly up to the API call
- ❌ API call fails with CORS error
- ✅ Error is properly caught and logged

## Conclusion

The GitHub OAuth Device Flow implementation is **architecturally complete** but **practically impossible** in a pure client-side application due to GitHub's CORS policy. The recommended path forward is to implement a Personal Access Token flow while clearly documenting the limitation for users.
