# Final Shared Link Conversation Persistence Fix

## The Problem
When re-opening a shared link (same URL with same password), the conversation history was not being restored from localStorage, even though both uses of the same link intentionally share the same namespace.

## Root Causes Found
1. **Master Key Caching**: The `getMasterKey()` function only checked `window._sharedLinkMasterKey` but not the cached values
2. **Incorrect Flag**: `isReturningToExistingNamespace` was always set to `false` for shared links
3. **Missing Reload Trigger**: Even with the master key available, conversation reload wasn't triggered

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Master Key Retrieval (`namespace-service.js`)
```javascript
// Now checks all caches, not just window._sharedLinkMasterKey
const sharedLinkMasterKey = window._sharedLinkMasterKey || sharedLinkMasterKeyCache || state.current.sharedLinkMasterKey;
```

### 2. Fixed Namespace Detection (`namespace-service.js`)
```javascript
// Now detects if we're returning to existing namespace by checking localStorage
let hasExistingData = false;
const namespacePrefix = `${sharedLinkNamespace}_`;
for (let i = 0; i < localStorage.length; i++) {
    const key = localStorage.key(i);
    if (key && key.startsWith(namespacePrefix)) {
        hasExistingData = true;
        break;
    }
}
state.isReturningToExistingNamespace = hasExistingData;
```

### 3. Added Fallback Conversation Loading (`shared-link-data-processor.js`)
- Direct check for namespaced data if flag isn't set
- Fallback attempt to load conversation if master key is available
- Multiple paths to ensure conversation is loaded

## How It Works Now

1. **First Open of Shared Link:**
   - Password decrypts payload → extracts master key
   - Creates namespace with that master key
   - Stores conversation in localStorage (encrypted with master key)

2. **Re-opening Same Shared Link:**
   - Password decrypts payload → extracts same master key
   - Detects existing data in localStorage with namespace prefix
   - Sets `isReturningToExistingNamespace = true`
   - Loads and decrypts conversation from localStorage
   - OR fallback path: directly attempts to load conversation with master key

## Testing
Use `test_shared_link_persistence_v2.html` to verify:
1. Open direct visit, create conversation
2. Generate share link with password
3. Open share link → conversation loads
4. Close and re-open same link → conversation persists

## Key Console Messages to Verify Success
```
[SharedLinkDataProcessor] Found existing data with namespace prefix
[SharedLinkDataProcessor] Returning to existing namespace
[ChatManager] Reloading conversation history
```

## Security Model Maintained
- Master keys for shared links are NEVER persisted to disk
- Only kept in memory variables
- Page reload requires re-entering password
- Same shared link = same namespace = shared conversation (by design)
