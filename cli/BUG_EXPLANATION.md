# The Bug That Broke Everything

## The Problem in `ShowSettingsV2Fixed`

The "fixed" version actually LOST all keyboard events! Here's why:

```go
// BROKEN CODE:
for {
    // Poll the first event
    ev := m.screen.PollEvent()  // <-- We get the arrow key event here!

    // Then we call HandleInputBatched...
    selected, escaped := m.menu.HandleInputBatched(m.screen)
    // But HandleInputBatched tries to poll MORE events:
    //   for screen.HasPendingEvent() { ... }
    // Since we already consumed the event, HasPendingEvent() returns false!
    // The arrow key event is LOST forever!
}
```

## What Happened:

1. User presses arrow key
2. `PollEvent()` consumes it from the queue and returns it
3. We store it in `ev` but DON'T process it
4. We call `HandleInputBatched()` which checks `HasPendingEvent()`
5. The queue is empty (we already consumed the event!)
6. `HandleInputBatched` returns without doing anything
7. The arrow key press is completely ignored

## The Correct Fix:

```go
// CORRECT CODE:
for {
    // Poll ONE event
    ev := m.screen.PollEvent()

    // ACTUALLY PROCESS THE EVENT WE JUST POLLED!
    selected, escaped := m.menu.HandleInput(ev)  // <-- Process it!
}
```

## Lesson Learned:

When you poll an event with `PollEvent()`, you MUST process it. You can't poll it and then expect it to still be in the queue for another function to poll again!

The original approach was actually correct - process events one at a time. The issue with "half the events registering" was likely due to:
1. Drawing being too slow
2. Or some other timing issue
3. But NOT due to the event processing pattern itself

## Testing:

Run `./test_diagnostic` to see:
- Original version: Some lag but works
- "Fixed" version: COMPLETELY BROKEN - no events register
- Correct version: Works properly
- Direct tcell: Proves tcell itself works fine
