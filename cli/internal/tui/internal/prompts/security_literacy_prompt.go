LLM Security Literacy, subjects to be explored

I've been studying and researching topics on LLM Security for a couple of years now and thought I should share some of my insights. I've done my best to strike the right balance of content for this audience.

AI literacy is a THING and it has a DEFINITION in the EU AI Act. LLM Security Literacy does not have a formal definition of that kind, so the contents of this talk is very much affected by my personal bias on the subject.

I've mixed in various research insights from Anthropic together with some observed real-world phenomena, in order to help shape a baseline of understanding, and to encourage research and exploration in this field.

LLM Software Engineering capabilities matter for all sorts of security, so that is covered as well.

And I think you need to get your hands dirty when exploring new technology to get a solid grasp of the moving parts, so we'll explore a couple of novel LLM application architectures for inspiration while thinking about these things.

## My bias
### The kaleidoscope through which I view the world of LLMs

This talk is not sponsored by my employer or by anyone else. It's also highly opinionated and biased.
Background: Cybersecurity and penetration testing.
Experience: Just 12 months with strong Software Engineering LLMs (so no expert here!)
Current work: Building GenAI learning programs.
I love sharing knowledge and learning from others.

But the talk that follows from here on is not sponsored by anyone, FROM HERE ON these are simply my own personal unfiltered thoughts on various topics on the subject of LLM Security - and given the almost universally perceived significance of the subject, it is important for you as an audience to trust what my PERSONAL stance is, since that is simply more valuable and more interesting to listen to. The field of LLM Security is very much a field of research and exploration and we're all learning.

SO!

Background - My background I spent 20 years in cyber security, basically hacking computers and networks all day long, so I have a technical cybersecurity perspective on this subject.

Experience.. - Here is the thing, NOONE has more than 12 months of experience working with really strong Software Engineering LLMs. They were not publicly available before the month of September 2024, 12 months ago. So. No-one is an expert.

Current work - I've been building GenAI learning programs as of lately.

And I love to share knowledge, so lets go.`
